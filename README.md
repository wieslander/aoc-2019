# Advent of Code 2019

Solutions to Advent of Code 2019.

All solutions are written in Rust and expects their input on stdin.  To
run the solution for, say, day 15 part 2, run:

    $ cargo run --bin 15-02 < inputs/15.txt

(Replace `inputs/15.txt` with your own puzzle input)

I'm using this year's AoC to get familiar with Rust, so some of the
solutions probably aren't as idiomatic as they could be.  Be gentle!
